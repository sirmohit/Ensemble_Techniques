    "Q1. What is boosting in machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Boosting is a machine learning technique that combines weak learners (classifiers or regression models with limited predictive power) to create a strong learner with improved predictive accuracy. The process involves iteratively training a sequence of models, each one designed to correct the errors of its predecessors, until the overall performance of the model reaches a satisfactory level. The final model is an ensemble of these weak learners, where each model's weight is determined based on its performance in the training process."

    "\n",
    "Train an initial weak learner: The first model is trained on the original data set, usually a simple model like a decision tree with a limited depth.\n",

The basic idea is to focus on the misclassified samples by the previous models and assign them more weight to increase their importance in the next iteration. The algorithm trains a series of weak models, each of which focuses on a different subset of the data. In each iteration, the algorithm adds a new weak model to the ensemble, with more weight given to the samples that were misclassified by the previous models. The final prediction is a weighted sum of the predictions of all the weak models. By combining the predictions of multiple weak models, boosting algorithms can create a more accurate and robust model that can generalize well to new data.\n",
